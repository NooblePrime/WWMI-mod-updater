I saw that nobody was making a fix executable for 2.2 but I wanted one so I made it and decided to share it here in case anybody else wants it. Should work for just about any mod, but if it's missing some hashes, let me know and I'll add them.<br><br>This is entirely made usingÂ <a href="https://gamebanana.com/tools/18446">Gustav0_'s fix for 1.4</a> as a base, so full credit to <a href="https://gamebanana.com/members/2890460">Gustav0_</a>. To be honest, all I did was update it to include the new hashes. The code itself was made in such a way that it would be very easy to maintain if the need arose, so I wouldn't have been able to do this so easily without the original creator's foresight.
